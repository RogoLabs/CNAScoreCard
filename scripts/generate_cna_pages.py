# This file has been removed as individual CNA pages are no longer generated.
# The system now uses web/cna/cna-detail.html as a unified page for all CNAs.
# 
# Historical note: This script previously generated individual HTML files for each CNA,
# but the architecture has been simplified to use a single dynamic page that loads
# CNA-specific data via JavaScript based on URL parameters.
#
# For CNA data generation, see: cnascorecard/generate_static_data.py
